"We are aware of the validation errors; we've 
written the invalid CSS intentionally. 
We take a much more pragmatic approach than saying "all CSS must validate." 
In the real world, that just doesn't work if you want to actually take advantage 
of the flexibility and functionality that CSS provides. 

Validating is great, and something you should do, but a spec is only as good 
as its actual usability based on browser support."

-jQuery UI Core Developer, on the subject of CSS validation.
